I added the Operational Guidance Document to the doc directory on my fork of the EPA CMAQ github site.

You can see it here (still needs editing (tables aren't correctly drawn and images are not yet linked – I need to fix this and other markdown conversion issues.)):
https://github.com/lizadams/CMAQ/blob/5.2Beta/CCTM/docs/User_Manual/CMAQ_OGD_index.md

I took the following steps:

* Fork the CMAS-CENTER repository 

[https://github.com/CMASCenter/EPA-CMAQ](https://github.com/CMASCenter/EPA-CMAQ)

* Using the following instructions

[https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

* This places a copy of the CMASCenter code on my personal online github site.
My individual fork is now:

[https://github.com/lizadams/CMAQ/tree/5.2Beta](https://github.com/lizadams/CMAQ/tree/5.2Beta)

* From your individual fork, clone a working copy to your desktop or to killdevil.  Make the edits and changes locally.
Commit them locally, then push them up to your individual forked project.
to clone the repository from my personal online github site to get a copy of it on my local machine:


* using either ssh     (this didn't work for Jo Ellen)
<pre><code>
git clone -b 5.2Beta git@github.com:lizadams/CMAQ.git CMAQ_v5.2Beta
</code></pre>

* or using https  
<pre><code>
git clone -b 5.2Beta https://github.com/lizadams/CMAQ.git CMAQ_v5.2Beta
</code></pre>

* edit the markdown docs under the following directory:
<pre><code>
    cd CCTM/docs/User_Manual/
</code></pre>

* The Atom.io editor allows you to view a preview of what the markdown document will look like in github. Download installer from:

[https://atom.io](https://atom.io)

* Load a the project directory, select a file *.md to edit, then use the command control+shift+m, and you will see the preview markdown screen of the file.
 
* To see what had changed used the command:
<pre><code>
    git status
</code></pre>

I decided to synch to the upstream branch (EPA's github site) to be sure I had all/any changes that they have made.
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository]

Here are the instructions that I followed in my local repository

* Change directory to local repository
<pre><code>
    cd /Users/lizadams/local_git_lizadams_cmaq/CMAQ_v5.2Beta
</code></pre>
* Add EPA's github site as upstream repository
<pre><code>
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git
</code></pre>
* show a list of the origin and upstream repositories
<pre><code>
    git remote –v
</code></pre>

* get code for all branches and put it in my local git repository
<pre><code>
    git fetch upstream
</code></pre>
* be sure that we are on the 5.2Beta Branch
<pre><code>
    git checkout 5.2Beta
</code></pre>

* This command I used to tell git to track an added file on my local git repository:
<pre><code>
    git add CCTM/docs/User_Manual/CMAQ_OGD_index.md
</code></pre>
* This command commits the changes for all added files
<pre><code>
    git commit -m "fixed links on OGD index"
</code></pre>
* This command pushes the local changes to my online github repository
<pre><code>
    git push
</code></pre>
* Once everything looks good on our individual github forked project, we would each need to do a pull request to the CMASCenter/EPA-CMAQ project. 
Once the documentation is at the point where it is ready for the EPA to review,
we need to do pull request and ask them to review and then incorporate the changes into their github site.
