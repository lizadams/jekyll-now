I added the Operational Guidance Document to the doc directory on my fork of the EPA CMAQ github site.

You can see it here (still needs editing (tables aren't correctly drawn and images are not yet linked – I need to fix this and other markdown conversion issues.))
https://github.com/lizadams/CMAQ/blob/5.2Beta/CCTM/docs/User_Manual/CMAQ_OGD_index.md

I took the following steps:

1. Fork the EPA repository using the following instructions
 https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

2. to get a copy of EPA's codes on my personal online github site.

3. clone the repository from my personal online github site to get a copy of it on my local machine:

```
  git clone -b 5.2Beta git@github.com:lizadams/CMAQ.git CMAQ_v5.2Beta
```

4. copied  the OGD markdown docs under the following directory:

~~~ csh
cd CCTM/docs/User_Manual/
~~~

5. To see what had changed used the command:
~~~csh
git status
~~~

I found that there were files that are in a modified state other than the file that I changed.
I am not sure what to do with those files (junit.F and CSQY_DATA.F, so I am leaving them as is for now).  
We need to ask EPA about what to do with files that are in a modified state ??)
~~~csh
/Users/lizadams/local_git_lizadams_cmaq/CMAQ/CMAQ_v5.2Beta
dhcp-v880-20-00379:CMAQ_v5.2Beta lizadams$ git status

I decided to synch to the upstream branch (EPA's github site) to be sure I had all/any changes that they have made.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository

Here are the instructions that I followed in my local repository

1. Change directory to local repository
~~~
cd /Users/lizadams/local_git_lizadams_cmaq/CMAQ_v5.2Beta
~~~
2. Add EPA's github site as upstream repository
~~~
 git remote add upstream https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git
~~~
3. show a list of the origin and upstream repositories
~~~
git remote –v
~~~

4. get code for all branches and put it in my local git repository
~~~
git fetch upstream  
~~~
5. be sure that we are on the 5.2Beta Branch
~~~
git checkout 5.2Beta
~~~

6. This command I used to tell git to track an added file on my local git repository:
~~~
git add CCTM/docs/User_Manual/CMAQ_OGD_index.md
~~~
7. This command commits the changes for all added files
~~~
git commit -m "fixed links on OGD index"
~~~
8. This command pushes the local changes to my online github repository
~~~
git push
~~~
9. Once the documentation is at the point where it is ready for the EPA to review,
we need to do pull request and ask them to review and then incorporate the changes into their github site.

I also found a site that has tips on the Markdown syntax:
